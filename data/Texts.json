	"Intro":{
		"1_":"Nowadays, most people know what UFOs are and quickly imagine a small round saucer with lights. But the representation of UFO despite the popularity of the saucer has not always been perceived in the same way by people.",
		"2_":"If we look at the graph here, we can see that an extremely important census is made on UFO sightings in the world. And in particular in the regions of developed countries like Europe, United States etc. A very interesting point to underline is that in this same period the cinematographic culture has also developed in a lightning way in the same regions of the world.",
		"3_":"The idea of this work is to visualize the evolution of the vision of people towards UFOs from the 20th century to today. And according to the cinematographic culture linked to these periods.",
		"4_":"Today science fiction is a type of film that is one of the most watched in the world. In particular in Europe and in the United States. Most of these films show space exploration and confrontation with extraterrestrial beings of humans. We could therefore ask ourselves if the movies can impact the vision of people on the ideas they have of UFOs and therefore have an impact on the number of UFO sightings.",
		"5_":"As you can see on this graph. The shape of each UFO varies a lot according to the time. One could therefore at first sight think that there is a parameter which makes people's vision vary.",
		"6_":"At the end of this work, we are going to look at how the cinematographic culture of science fiction has impacted the vision of people in the world of UFOs.",
		"7_":"To do so, we will go through all these eras and present you with the key films that have allowed for impactful changes in the image of UFOs. And this from the beginning of the 1900's until today."
